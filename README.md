Description: *Tutorial of React Native authentication app -- Tutorial.md file and code generated doing it (only portuguese version available yet).*

## Branches

Basically, we have various branches, the main ones are: master, tutorialMaking and tutorialFolloing.

The master branch is just one future project to implement some CD and CI in one heroku-like platform.

The 'tutorialMaking' is the branch that documents and saves my work while I'm making this tutorial; yes, the process of making it will be documented also.

The 'tutorialFollowing' is a branch created to anyone that want follow the code while reading the tutorial, maybe to compare with your own code, or to follow the tutorial without coding.

## Current branch

The current branch is one maked to test the tutorial that inspired me to do this repo: access the tutorial <https://blog.rocketseat.com.br/autenticacao-no-react-native-reactjs-com-context-api-hooks/>
