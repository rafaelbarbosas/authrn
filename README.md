Tutorial of React Native authentication app (Tutorial.md -- only portuguese version available yet) and code generated doing it

##Branches

Basically, we have three branches: master, tutorialMaking and tutorialFolloing.
The master branch is just one future project to implement some CD and CI in one heroku-like platform.
The 'tutorialMaking' is the branch that documents and saves my work while I'm making this tutorial; yes, the process of making it will be documented also.
The 'tutorialFollowing' is a branch created to anyone that want follow the code while reading the tutorial, maybe to compare with your own code, or to follow the tutorial without coding.
